Archive.org also has stored a large amount of posts on Usenet. Usenet was a sort of early social network built around constructing forums and IRC chat. It operated somewhere between Reddit, Email, RSS, and an actual Chatroom. They also include IRC logs, which could be a huge asset, but the IRC logs that are stored on archive.org don't even come close to the total amount of discussion that ocurred on public IRC chats during the peak of their usage.}
