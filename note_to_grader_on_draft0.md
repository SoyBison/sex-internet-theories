Note to grader:

My work on this assignment is roughly an hour out of sync with the class. This is because I woke up late on Monday, the 20th of april. I still set timers and whatnot to keep the submissions temporally in line with the module on canvas, just asynchronously. Hopefully this is enough such that my grade for this activity isn't docked.

Thanks,
